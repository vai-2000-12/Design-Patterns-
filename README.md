# Design Patterns - A Comprehensive Guide

## 📌 Overview
This repository is a structured guide for learning and implementing **Design Patterns** using **Object-Oriented Design Principles**. It covers theoretical concepts, code implementations, and problem-solving approaches to help master design patterns effectively.

## 🔥 Why Study Design Patterns?
- Improve **code reusability, maintainability, and scalability**.
- Follow best practices for **software architecture**.
- Enhance **problem-solving** skills in **System Design & Low-Level Design (LLD)**.
- Prepare for **technical interviews and real-world software development**.

## 🛠️ Object-Oriented Design Principles (SOLID)
Before diving into design patterns, understanding **OO principles** is essential:
1. **S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. **O** - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
3. **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. **I** - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

These principles guide the implementation of well-structured design patterns.

## 📂 Design Patterns Covered
Design patterns are categorized into three main types:

### 1️⃣ Creational Patterns 🏗️
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms:
- **Singleton** - Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Factory Method** - Creates objects without specifying their exact type.
- **Abstract Factory** - Provides an interface for creating families of related objects.
- **Builder** - Constructs complex objects step by step.
- **Prototype** - Clones existing objects.

### 2️⃣ Structural Patterns 🏛️
These patterns define how objects and classes are composed:
- **Adapter** - Bridges two incompatible interfaces.
- **Decorator** - Adds behavior dynamically to objects.
- **Proxy** - Controls access to objects.
- **Facade** - Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
- **Composite** - Composes objects into tree structures to represent hierarchies.
- **Bridge** - Separates abstraction from implementation.


### 3️⃣ Behavioral Patterns 🎭
These patterns focus on object interactions:
- **Observer** - Implements a publish-subscribe mechanism.
- **Strategy** - Defines interchangeable algorithms.
- **State** - Allows an object to change its behavior based on its state.
- **Command** - Encapsulates a request as an object.
- **Chain of Responsibility** - Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
- **Mediator** - Centralizes communication between objects.
- **Iterator** - Provides sequential access to a collection.
- **Template Method** - Defines a skeleton for an algorithm.

## 📜 Code Implementations
Each design pattern is implemented in **Java**, with clear explanations and real-world examples.
- `CreationalPatterns/Singleton.java`
- `StructuralPatterns/Adapter.java`
- `BehavioralPatterns/Strategy.java`

You can navigate the `src/` folder for code implementations with comments.
